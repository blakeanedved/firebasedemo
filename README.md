#### General Firebase Intro
Firebase is a platform for rapid app protoyping, built and maintained by Google. It offers features such as web app hosting, databases, file storage, cloud functions, and it even has Machine Learning Capabilities. Not only is it easy to use, it has a very generous free tier of usage. Firebase supports many platforms, including, but not limited to: Web, Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.

#### Cloud Hosting
Firebase Cloud Hosting is a service that will let you host static web pages for free on Firebase. Not only do you get a free Firebase domain, you also get free Google-grade TLS. Also since Cloud Firestore is a Firebase service, it has seamless integration will all the other Firebase services.

#### Cloud Firestore
Firebase Cloud Firestore is the newest version of the previously named Firebase Realtime Database. Cloud Firestore is a document based realtime database, which means that any amount of users/apps can have an active connection to the database to instantly get new data when it is entered into the database.

#### Cloud Storage
Firebase Cloud Storage exactly like having a file system on a server, as you can store whatever files you want, and the Firebase Storage SDK will allow you to generate a download link to any file. Because Cloud Firestore cannot store files (unless you get creative), Cloud Storage and Cloud Firestore go hand in hand.

#### Cloud Functions
Firebase Cloud Functions are one of the most powerful features of Firebase, as they do exactly what you think they should, runnable funtions in the cloud. These functions can use any NodeJS package you want and have seamless integration with almost every Google Service. Not only can you chose to run the functions, you can also set triggers for each function to run, such as an http endpoint to build an API, or run a function when a new user is created, etc...
